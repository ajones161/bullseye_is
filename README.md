My clunky, messy, 'at least she's pretty' final project for IT:PA. It's an inventory system for a fictional spoting goods company.

This thing took four months. It's absolutely not perfect, as I know it doesn't hit a few of the requirements that were asked of me and there were a _lot_ of bugs. I'm storing this here mostly so I can redo this later, look back on it, and see how far I've come.
